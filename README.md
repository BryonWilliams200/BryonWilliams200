# 👋 Hi, I'm Bryon Williams

I'm a developer focused on building practical, clean, and scalable and fun projects.
I care about understanding how things work such as the inner workings of outdated technology — not just making them run.

## 🧠 What I'm working on
- Personal projects to sharpen my skills and create ease of accessability
- Backend + systems fundamentals
- Writing better, cleaner code over time
- Using my resources to my advantage

## 🛠️ Skills
- Programming Languages: Python (NumPy, SciPy, Automation Scripting), C, JavaScript, Bash/Shell Scripting

- Systems and 
 
- Tools: Git, Linux, GitHub, Chromebook Terminal, Virtual Machine Crafting,
- Concepts: Data structures, APIs, debugging

## 📂 Projects
- 🔹  Lunbuntu Virtual Machine Deployment via QEMU in (ChromeOS Environment) – Built and optimized a Lubuntu virtual machine using the QEMU software within a very constrained ChromeOS Linux environment. I manually configured CPU features, memory allocation, disk boot sequencing, the (QCOW2), and multi-threaded emulation, while automating the deployment through shell scripting and implemented a desktop launcher for streamlined VM execution. I focused on system level debugging, virtualization architecture, and performance tuning under infrastructure limitations. (I have a physical launch button for the virtual machine).

- 🔹 **Engiguide The Ai Assistant for The Florida A&M College of Engineering – This was a research project I worked on with a graduate student at the College of Enginrrt
