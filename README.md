# 👋 Hi, I'm Bryon Williams

I'm a developer focused on building practical, clean, and scalable and fun projects.
I care about understanding how things work such as the inner workings of outdated technology — not just making them run.

## 🧠 What I'm working on
- Personal projects to sharpen my skills and create ease of accessability
- Backend + systems fundamentals
- Writing better, cleaner code over time
- Using my resources to my advantage

## 🧠 What I'm interested in
I am interested in systems optimization, automation, and infrastructure-level problem solving.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills
- Programming Languages: Python (NumPy, SciPy, Automation Scripting), C, JavaScript, Bash/Shell Scripting

- Systems and Virtualization: QEMU system emulation, Linux system configuration, Virtual machine deployment (QCOW2, TCG acceleration), Resource optimization & CPU throttling, Boot process configuration

- Industrial & Control Systems: PLC Programming, Ladder Logic Development, Industrial I/O Logic Design, Timer/Counter Instructions, Basic Motor & Control Circuit Logic, Control system troubleshooting
  
- Tools & Platforms: Git & GitHub, VS Code, Linux (Crostini/Ubuntu-based environments), QEMU CLI, Chromebook Terminal, Virtual Machine Crafting
 
- Concepts: Data structures, APIs, Debugging & system-level troubleshooting, Virtualization architecture

## 📂 Projects
- 🔹 **Lunbuntu Virtual Machine Deployment via QEMU in (ChromeOS Environment) – Built and optimized a Lubuntu virtual machine using the QEMU software within a very constrained ChromeOS Linux environment. I manually configured CPU features, memory allocation, disk boot sequencing, the (QCOW2), and multi-threaded emulation, while automating the deployment through shell scripting and implemented a desktop launcher for streamlined VM execution. I focused on system level debugging, virtualization architecture, and performance tuning under infrastructure limitations.

- 🔹 **Engiguide The Ai Assistant for The Florida A&M College of Engineering – This was a research project I worked on with a graduate student at the College of Engineering

- 🔹 **Custom Linux Utility Tools (ChromeOS Linux) - A collection of utility applications and automation scripts built in Python to imptove workflow efficiency within a ChromeOS Linux environment. Includes custom VM launch automation and a physical hardware trigger configured to execute system-level scripts for streamlined deployment.

- 🔹 **PLC Control Logic Projects - Designed and implemented ladder logic programs to control discrete LED outputs using input-triggered state logic, timers, and latching circuits. Developed sequential logic patterns and basic interlock structures to simulate industrial control behaviors.
